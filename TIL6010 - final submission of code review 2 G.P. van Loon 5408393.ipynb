    "- Some elements might not be applicable, so mark it as Not applicable.\n",
    "- Provide specific comments using code line numbers, variable name, etc.\n",
    "- Use the [Pep-8 standard](https://pep8.org) to address each element in the rubric\n",
    "- Screenshot the finalized table and submit it under the issue page of your partner's repository. An example code review screenshot can be found [here](https://github.com/Panchamy/TIL6010/issues/5)\n",

    "In general, there are other criterias for code reviews , especially for large code bases. You can find an exhaustive list [here](https://deepsource.io/blog/python-code-review-checklist/). However, in this course, we are only looking at readability metrics."
