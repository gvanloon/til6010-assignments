    "- Invite your partner to your repository (by using their Github account name in the spread sheet). You are already familiar with how to add a collaborator , but here is a [reference](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) \n",

    "For the review assignment, you are going to assess your partner code based on the following rubric. \n",
    "- Some elements might not be applicable, so mark it as Not applicable.\n",
    "- Provide specific comments using code line numbers, variable name, etc.\n",
    "- Use the [Pep-8 standard](https://pep8.org) to address each element in the rubric\n",
    "- Screenshot the finalized table and submit it under the issue page of your partner's repository. An example code review screenshot can be found [here](https://github.com/Panchamy/TIL6010/issues/5)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are other criterias for code reviews , especially for large code bases. You can find an exhaustive list [here](https://deepsource.io/blog/python-code-review-checklist/). However, in this course, we are only looking at readability metrics."
